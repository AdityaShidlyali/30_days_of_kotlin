fun main() {
    // The below is variable declaration :
    // var or val variable_name: Datatype
    var name: String

    // Below is the variable initialisation
    name = "Aditya Shidlyali"

    // One more method to declare variable is :
    var firstName = "Aditya"

    val i = 3.142 // Kotlin compiler automatically considers this as the floating type value

    firstName = "Steve" // This is the mutable variable as it is defined with var keyword
    val lastName = "Doe" // This is the immutable variable as it is defined with val keyword
    // lastName = "Any String" will give the error as it is immutable
